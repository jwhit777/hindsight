## The 30-second pitch

Every existing LLM-agent observability tool is hosted SaaS or framework-locked. Langfuse, LangSmith, Arize Phoenix, Helicone, Datadog LLM, and Laminar all want your data on their cloud or your SDK in their flavor. When an Anthropic FDE walks into a Fortune 100 customer with regulated data and an existing OpenTelemetry collector, none of them are a drop-in. The customer's question is *"my agent is failing in production, where did it go wrong?"* — they want a step-by-step view, a way to re-run from the point of failure, and a way to diff a known-good run against the broken one. That's a primitive, not a product.

Hindsight is that primitive: a local-first, pip-installable CLI + library that ingests any trace format, normalizes it to a canonical schema, and exposes step-through, diff, and replay-from-step over it. No accounts, no cloud, stdlib Python core.

```
$ pip install hindsight-trace
$ hindsight ingest my-failing-run.jsonl
  → ingested 23 steps (4 agent · 11 llm · 8 tool) → run_2026-05-15T09-12-44

$ hindsight show run_2026-05-15T09-12-44
  ROUTER  → orchestrator/route_to_subagent
    LLM   ─ claude-haiku-4-5  ▸ 412 tok in / 38 tok out  (180 ms)
    TOOL  ─ subagent.dispatch("stock-analyst")  (2 ms)
    AGENT ─ stock-analyst
      LLM ─ claude-sonnet-4-6  ▸ 8 412 tok in / 1 220 tok out  (4 110 ms)
      TOOL─ get_quote("AAPL")  → ERROR(rate_limited)             ⚠
      ... 17 more steps

$ hindsight diff run_GOOD run_BAD
  divergence at step #6 (TOOL get_quote):
    GOOD: got_quote → continued to summarise
    BAD : rate_limited → retried 3x → context overflow → hallucinated quote

$ hindsight replay run_BAD --from-step 6 --model claude-sonnet-4-6
  [LIVE] re-running 18 downstream steps with sonnet-4-6 in place of haiku-4-5...
  → succeeds. 4 270 ms total. 12 580 tok.
```

That's the whole demo. One Linux box, one trace file, four commands.

## Why this exists (the trendlines)

Three independent curves converge here:

1. **Agents in production, exponential.** Every 2026 FDE / Applied AI posting lists "deployment at scale" and "production LLM experience" as universal requirements. [Anthropic + Blackstone + Goldman Sachs + Hellman & Friedman announced a $1.5B enterprise-AI JV on 2026-05-04](https://www.anthropic.com/news/enterprise-ai-services-company); [OpenAI launched its Deployment Company plus a Tomoro acquisition on 2026-05-11](https://openai.com/index/openai-launches-the-deployment-company/). The number of enterprise agents in production is on a near-vertical curve. Each one will, at some point, fail in production. None of the failure modes can be debugged from logs.

2. **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions, real but unfinished.** [OTEL GenAI semconv](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) defines `gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.provider.name`, plus span shapes for agent and framework. Status: experimental. Vendor adoption: real. Datadog [shipped support in OTel v1.37](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/); Grafana started collecting LLM traces in Loki. Whoever ships a *cross-vendor reader* before the spec stabilises owns the integration layer.

3. **The "deterministic replay as missing primitive" thesis.** Sakura Sky's 2026 series calls deterministic replay [the missing primitive for trustworthy AI](https://www.sakurasky.com/blog/missing-primitives-for-trustworthy-ai-part-8/). [Tian Pan independently argues the same on his blog (2026-04)](https://tianpan.co/blog/2026-04-12-deterministic-replay-debugging-non-deterministic-ai-agents). The [Litmus](https://github.com/rylinjames/litmus) and [agent-replay](https://github.com/manasvardhan/agent-replay) GitHub projects attack the HTTP-interception slice but neither does cross-format ingest nor diff. [arxiv 2505.17716](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17716) makes the academic case for record + replay in agent loops. The thesis is converging from three directions; what's missing is a polished, documented, pip-installable tool that hits all three.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

A trace from any supported source is parsed by a format-specific *ingester* into the canonical `TraceRun` dataclass tree. Each `TraceStep` is one of {`AGENT`, `LLM`, `TOOL`, `DECISION`} and carries `request`, `response`, `latency_ms`, `tokens_in/out`, `parent_id`, plus a free-form `extra` dict for adapter-local fields. Operations are pure functions over `TraceRun`: `show()` walks the tree, `stats()` aggregates, `diff(a, b)` aligns step-by-step and reports the first divergence, `replay(run, from_step, model_override)` re-emits requests live from step *n* onward. The optional web UI (Phase 2) is a FastAPI server that re-uses the same library; nothing in the core talks HTTP unless `--live` is passed. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full diagram.

## Quickstart

```
cd src/
python3 spike_run.py        # runs the spike end-to-end
python3 -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py' -v   # 31 tests across 3 suites
```

## What's already done

* Canonical schema written, 4 step types, lossless JSONL round-trip.
* Four ingesters (JSONL, LangSmith run-tree, OTEL GenAI, Langfuse) writing into the same canonical. Cross-format structural identity is a tested invariant.
* `show()`, `stats()`, `diff()`, `replay()` all working in stdlib Python (no numpy, no pydantic). CLI adds `ci diff --gate` (PR-check exit codes) and `validate` (schema conformance). Live providers (Anthropic, OpenAI) sit behind the `[live]` extra.
* `BaseIngester` Protocol — third parties can register new format adapters without touching the core.
* Fixtures cover three divergence patterns (routing, LLM-content, tool-call) plus four cross-format identity fixtures (jsonl, langsmith, otel, langfuse).
* `spike_run.py` runs end-to-end, prints a calibration-card-style report.
* 31 tests across `test_spike.py` (13), `test_replay.py` (9), and `test_cli_verbs.py` (9) — covering cross-format identity, round-trip, three divergence patterns, stats math, replay semantics, lazy-import guards for live providers, and CLI exit codes.
* All tests pass on Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12 in CI; total spike runtime is single-digit milliseconds.

Spike output captured verbatim in [`SPIKE.md`](./SPIKE.md).

## Use in CI

`hindsight ci diff` is the PR-check variant of `diff`. With `--gate`, it
exits 1 on any divergence — drop it into a GitHub Actions step and a PR
that regresses a known-good trace fails before merge.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/regression-gate.yml
name: trace-regression
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: { python-version: "3.12" }
      - run: pip install hindsight-trace
      - name: Run the agent and capture a trace
        run: python scripts/run_agent.py > runs/head.jsonl
      - name: Gate the PR on the cross-run diff
        run: hindsight ci diff baseline/good.jsonl runs/head.jsonl --gate --md
```

`hindsight validate <path>` is the lighter companion — exits 0 on canonical
conformance, 2 on schema violation, 1 on missing file. Use it as a cheap
first-pass check before the diff.

## What ships next

See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md). Three concrete next items, independent:

- **Reserve `hindsight-trace` on PyPI** — the v0.1.0 wheel + sdist are already built and attached to the [v0.1.0 GitHub release](https://github.com/jwhit777/hindsight/releases/tag/v0.1.0); the upload itself is one `twine upload` away.
- **Validate the OTEL adapter against captured reality** — the current `otel_good.json` fixture was hand-written from the spec. Wire up `opentelemetry-instrumentation-anthropic`, capture a real `claude-haiku-4-5` call, ingest the resulting spans, and pin the captured trace as a fixture.
- **Flip the repo public** when the launch posture is ready.
